User Accounts: Supports signup, login, and personalized user sessions.
Secure Authentication: Protects user data with industry-standard authentication practices.
Responsive Interface: Clean, intuitive UI for seamless interactions across devices.

Technologies

Backend: Ruby on Rails
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Database: PostgreSQL
Authentication: Devise (or your chosen Rails authentication gem)
AI Integration: Custom AI logic for memory and emotional modeling

Why This App Stands Out

Demonstrates full-stack Rails expertise with authentication, AI integration, and responsive UI.
Implements persistent memory and dynamic behavior, showcasing advanced backend logic.
Highlights the ability to combine technical skill with UX considerations—something hiring managers value highly.

Future Improvements

Integration with external NLP services for more advanced AI capabilities.
Analytics dashboard to track conversation trends and user engagement.
Enhanced front-end experience with React or Stimulus.js for richer interactions.
